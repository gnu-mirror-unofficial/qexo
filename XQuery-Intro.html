    <h1>What is XQuery?</h1>

<h3>Per Bothner</h3>

<p>
The World Wide Web Consortium is working on finalizing
the specification for XQuery, aiming for a final release mid/late 2002.
XQuery is a powerful and convenient language
that is designed for processing XML data.
That means not just files in XML format, but also other data
(including databases) whose structure (nested named trees with attributes) is
similar to XML.
XQuery is an interesting language with some unusual ideas.
This article is intended to give you a hawk's-eye-view
of XQuery, introducing the main ideas you should understand before you
go deeper or actually try to use it!

<h2>An expression language</h2>
<p>
The first thing to notice is that in XQuery everything is
an expression that evaluates to a value.
An XQuery program or script is a just an expression, together
with optionally some function and other definitions.
So the following:</p>
<pre>
3+4
</pre>
<p>
is a complete and valid XQuery that evaluates to the integer <code>7</code>
<p>
There are no side-effects or updates in the XQuery standard,
though those will probably be added at a future date.
The standard specifies the <em>result value</em> of an
expression or program, but it does not specify <em>how</em>
it is to be evaluated.  Therefore an implementation has
considerable freedom in how it evaluates an XQuery program,
and what optimizations it does.</p>
<p>Here is a conditional expression that evaluates to a string:
<pre>
if (3 &lt; 4) then "yes!" else "no!"
</pre>
<p>
You can define local variable definitions using a <code>let</code>-expression:
<pre>
let $x := 5 let $y := 6 return 10*$x+$6
</pre>
This evaluates to 56.

<h2>Primitive data types</h2>
<p>
The primitives data types in XQuery are the same as for XML Schema.
<ul>
<li>Numbers, including integers and floating-point numbers.
<li>The boolean values true and false.
<!--XQuery doesn't have boolean literals in the usual sense,
but these function calls are used instead:
<code>false()</code>, <code>true()</code>.-->
<li>
Strings of characters, for example: <code>"Hello world!"</code>.
These are immutable - i.e. you cannot modify a character in a string.
<li>
Various types to represent dates, times, and durations.
<li>
A few XML-related types.  For example a <dfn>QName</dfn>
is a pair of a local name (like <code>template</code>)
and a URL, which is used to
represent a tag name like <code>xsl:template</code> after it has
been namespace-resolved.
</ul>
<dfn>Derived types</dfn> are variations or restrictions of
other types, for example range types.
Primitive types and the types derived from them are
known as <dfn>atomic types</dfn>, because an atomic value does
not contain other values.  Thus a string is considered atomic
because XQuery does not have character values.

<h2>Node values and expressions</h2>
<p>
XQuery of course also has the necessary data types needed to
represent XML values.
It does this using <dfn>node</dfn> values,
of which there are 7 kinds:
element, attribute, namespace, text, comment, processing-instruction,
and document (root) nodes.
These are very similar to the corresponding DOM classes
such as <code>Node</code>, <code>Element</code> and so on.
Some XQuery implementations use DOM objects to implement node values,
though implementations may use other representations.
<p>
Various standard XQuery functions create or return nodes.
For example the <code>document</code> function
reads an XML file specified by a URL argument,
and returns a document root node.
(The root element is a child of the root node.)
<p>
You can also create new node objects directly in the program.
The most convenient way to do that is to use an
<dfn>element constructor</dfn> expression,
which looks just like regular XML data:
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="index.html"&lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for info.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
You can use <code>{</code><dfn>curly braces</dfn><code>}</code>
to embed XQuery expression inside element constructors:
<pre>
let $i := 2 return
let $r := &lt;em&gt;Value &lt;/em&gt; return
  &lt;p&gt;{$r} of 10*{$i} is {10*$i}.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
creates:
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value &lt;/em&gt; of 10*2 is 20.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Popular <dfn>template processors</dfn> such as JSP, ASP, and PHP allow
you to embed expression is a programming language into HTML content.
XQuery gives you that ability, plus
the ability to embed XML/HTML forms inside expressions,
and to have them be the value of variables and parameters.
<p>
XQuery node values are immutable (you cannot modify a node after
it has been created).
<!--, but they do have <dfn>identity</dfn>.
The latter is the main difference between a text node
and a primitive string value.-->

<h2>Sequences</h2>
<p>
We've seen atomic values (numbers, strings, etc),
and node values (elements, attributes, etc).
These are together known as <dfn>simple values</dfn>.
XQuery expressions actually evaluate to <dfn>sequences</dfn> of
simple values.
The comma operator can be used to concatenate
two values or sequences.  For example:
<pre>
3,4,5
</pre>
is a sequence consisting of 3 integers.
Note that a sequence containing just single value is the same as
that value by itself, and you cannot nest sequences.
To illustrate this, we'll use
the <code>count</code> function, which takes one argument,
and returns the number of values in that sequence.
So this expression:
</pre>
<pre>
let $a := 3,4
let $b := ($a, $a)
let $c := 99
let $d := ()
return (count($a), count($b), count($c), count($d))
</pre>
evaluates to <code>(2, 4, 1, 0)</code>, because
<code>$b</code> is the same as <code>(3,4,3,4)</code>.
<p>
Many of the standard functions for working with nodes
return sequences.  For example, the <code>children</code> function
returns a sequence of the child nodes of the argument:
<pre>
children(&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cool.&lt;/p&gt;)
</pre>
returns this sequence of 3 values:
<pre>
"This is ", &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;, " cool."
</pre>

<h2>Path expressions and relationship to XPath</h2>
<p>
XQuery borrows <dfn>path expressions</dfn> from XPath.
In fact, XQuery can be viewed as a generalization of XPath:
Except for some obscure forms (mostly unusual "axis specifiers"),
all XPath expressions are also XQuery expressions.
For this reason the XPath specification is also being revised
by the XQuery committee, with the plan that XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0
will be released about the same time.</p>
<p>
The following simple example assumes an XML file <code>"mybook.xml"</code>
whose root element is a <code>&lt;book&gt;</code>,
and it contains some <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> children:
<pre>
let $book := document("mybook.xml")/book
return $book/chapter
</pre>
<p>
The <code>document</code> function returns the root node of a document.
The <code>/book</code> expression selects the child elements of the root
that are named <code>book</code>, so <code>$book</code> gets set to
the single root element.
The <code>$book/chapter</code> selects the child elements of the
top-level <code>book</code> elements, which results in a sequence
of the second-level <code>chapter</code> nodes, in <dfn>document order</dfn>.
<p>
The next element includes a <dfn>predicate</dfn>.
<pre>
$book//para[@class="warning"]
</pre>
<p>
The double slash is a convenience syntax to select all
descendants (rather than just children) of <code>$book</code>,
selecting only <code>&lt;para&gt;</code> element nodes
that have an attribute code named <code>class</code> whose
value is <code>"warning"</code>
<p>
One difference to note between XPath and XQuery is that XPath
expressions may return a <dfn>node set</dfn>, whereas the same
XQuery expression will return a node sequence.  For compatibility,
these sequences will be in <dfn>document order</dfn> and with
duplicates removed, which makes them equivalent to sets,
<p>
By the way:  XPath expressions are mostly used as patterns
in XSLT <dfn>stylesheets</dfn>.  XSLT (XSL Transformation,
where XSL stands for XML Stylesheet Language) is a rule-based
language for transforming an input XML document into a result
XML document.
XSLT is very useful for expressing very simple transformations,
but more complicated stylesheets (especially anything with
non-trivial logic or programming) can often be written more
compactly and readably using XQuery.

<h2>Iterating over sequences</h2>
<p>
A <code>for</code> expression lets you "loop" over the
elements of a sequence:
<pre>
for $x in (1 to 3) return $x,10+$x
</pre>
<p>
The <code>for</code> expression first evaluates the
expression following the <code>in</code>.
Then for each value of the resulting sequence,
the variable (in this case <code>$x</code>) is bound to the
value, and the <code>return</code> expression evaluated
using that variable binding.
The value of the entire <code>for</code> expression is the
concatenation of all values of the <code>return</code> expression, in order.
So the example evaluates to this 6-element sequence:
<pre>
1,11,2,12,3,13
</pre>
<p>
Here is a more useful example.
Assume again that <code>mybook.xml</code>
is a <code>&lt;book&gt;</code> that contains
some <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code>.elements.
Each <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> has a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.
The following will create a simple web page that just lists the titles:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;{
  let $book := document("mybook.xml")/book
  for $ch in $book/chapter
    return &lt;h2&gt;{$ch/title)&lt;/h2&gt;
}&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The term "FLWR expressions" includes both <code>for</code>
and <code>let</code> expressions.  The acronym FLWR refers to
the fact that it consists of one or more <code><u>f</u>or</code>
and/or <code><u>l</u>et</code> clauses,
an optional <code><u>w</u>here</code> clause,
and a <code><u>r</u>esult</code> clause.
A <code>where</code> clause causes the <code>result</code>
clause to be evaluated only when the <codewhere</code>
where expression is true.
<p>
Below is an example illustrating the <code>where</code>
clause.  This example has a nested loop, allowing us to combine
two sequences, one of customer elements , and the other of order elements.
We want to find the name(s) of customers who have ordered
the part whose <code>part_id</code> is <code>"xx"</code>.
<pre>
for $c in customers
for $o in orders
where $c.cust_id=$o.cust_id and $o.part_id="xx"
return $c.name
</pre>
<p>
<p>
This is essentially a <dfn>join</dfn> of two <dfn>tables</dfn>,
as commonly performed using relational databases.
An important goal for XQuery is that it should be
usable as a query language for "XML databases".
Compare the corresponding SQL statement:
<pre>
select customers.name
from customers, orders
where customers.cust_id=orders.cust_id
  and orders.part_id="xx"
</pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>
XQuery wouldn't be much of a programming language without
user-defined functions.  Such function definitions appear
in the <dfn>query prologue</dfn> of an XQuery program.
It is worth noting that that function parameters and
function results can be primitive values, nodes, or sequences of either.
<p>
Below we define a recursive utility function.
It returns all the descendant nodes of the argument,
including the argument node itself.
It does a depth-first traversal of the argument,
returning the argument, and then looping over the argument node's
children, recursively calling itself for each child.
<pre>
define function descendant-or-self ($x)
{
  $x,
  for $y in children($x)
    return descendant-or-self($y)
}
descendant-or-self(&lt;a&gt;X&lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)
</pre>
evaluates to this sequence of length 4::
<pre>
&lt;a&gt;X&lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; "X"; &lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt;; "Y"
</pre>

<h2>Sorting and context</h2>
<p>
If you want to sort a sequence you can use a <code>sortby</code>
expression. For example to sort a sequence of books
in order of author name you can do:
<pre>
$books sortby (author/name)
</pre>
<p>
The <code>sortby</code> takes an input sequence (in this
case <code>$books</code>) and one or more <dfn>ordering expressions</dfn>.
During sorting the implementation needs to compare two values
from the input sequence to determinate which comes first.
It does that by evaluating the ordering expression(s) in the
<dfn>context</dfn> of a value from the input sequence.
So the path expression <code>author/name</code> is evaluated
many times, each time relative to a different book as
the <dfn>context (or current) item</dfn>.
<p>
Path expressions also use and set the context.
For example in <code>author/name</code> the <code>name</code>
children that are returned are those of the context item,
which is an <code>author</code> item.

<h2>Type specification</h2>
<p>
XQuery is a strongly typed programming language.
Like Java, C#, and other languages, it is a mix
of static typing (type consistency checked at compile-time)
and dynamic typing (run-time type tests).
However, the types in XQuery are different from the classes
familiar from object-oriented programming.
Instead, it has types to match XQuery's data model,
and allows you to import types form XML Schema.
<pre>
if ($child instance of element section)
then process-section($child)
else ( ) {--nothing--}
</pre>
<p>
This invokes the <code>process-section</code> function
if the value of <code>$child</code> is an element whose
tag name is <code>section</code>.
XQuery has a convenient <code>typeswitch</code>
shorthand for matching a value against a number of types.
Here is an example to convert a set of tag names to
a different set.  It is a simple example of the kind of transformations
that XSLT does well.
<pre>
define function convert($x) {
  typeswitch ($x)
    case element para return &lt;p&gt;{process-children($x)}&lt;/p&gt;
    case element emph  return &lt;em&gt;{process-children($x)}&lt;/em&gt;
    default return process-children($x)
}
define function process-children($x) {
  for $ch in children($x) return convert($ch)
}
</pre>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
The primary XQuery resource is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query">http://www.w3.org/XML/Query</a>
at the World Wide Web Consortium.
This has links to the draft standards, mailing lists, and implementations.
The main documents are:
<ul>
<li>
The actual XQuery specification
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/</a>)
is not difficult to read, and is probably where you should go next.
<li>
The Data Model specification
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/query-datamodel/">http://www.w3.org/TR/query-datamodel/</a>)
goes into nodes and the functions you can use to manipulate them.
<li>
The Functions and Operators specification
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/</a>) defines the other (non-node) functions, including
string and date/time functions.
<li>
The Use Cases document
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlquery-use-cases">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlquery-use-cases</a>)
contains lots of useful examples of XQuery programs
to solve specific problems.
<li>
The Formal Semantics specification
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/query-semantics/">http://www.w3.org/TR/query-semantics/</a>)
uses formal mathematical notation and is not for the faint of heart.
Most people should skip it.
</ul>
<p>
There aren't many books on XQuery yet, mainly because there are significant
loose ends in the specification.
At the time of writing, there is one book:
<cite>Early Adopter XQuery</cite> from Wrox.
I am working with other authors on a book for Sams we hope will be ready
soon after the standard is finalized.
<p>
Obviously, there is no complete standards-conforming implementations either,
but XQuery site lists known implementations, some of which
have executable demos.
The only open-source implementation currently available
seems to be my own Qexo implementation
- see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/">http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/</a>.
(The Qexo implementation is interesting in that it compiles XQuery
programs on-the-fly directly to Java bytecodes.)
I welcome you to experiment with it. But in any case, I do recommend
considering XQuery when you need a powerful and convenient
tool for analyzing or generating XML.
