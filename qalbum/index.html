<p>
The idea of these scripts is that each <q>folder</q> (directory
of images) contains a descriptior file named <code>index.xml</code>,
which lists the images, along with captions or other descritive
information.  This <code>index.xml</code> can be created and managed
using various tools/scripts, or edited manually with a text editor.
Then running <code><a href="qalbum">qalbum</a></code> generates all
the HTML pages, creating scaled images as needed.
The resulting web pages can be uploaded to a web server, or
browsed as-is from the file system.
You can go back
and edit the <code>index.xml</code>, and then re-run
<code>qalbum</code> to get an updated web folder.</p>

<p>
Here is an <a href="http://pics.bothner.com/2003/Vancouver/">example</a>
page that illustrates many <code>qalbum</code> features, and here is the
<a href="http://pics.bothner.com/2003/Vancouver/index.xml">picture group
file</a> describing it.

<h2  id="Features">Features</h2>
<p>
There are a number of tools which do similar things.
This one has some nice little extras:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Uses JavaScript for some useful effects,
but works fine without it.</li>
<li>All the <q>fancy</q> features are implemented using
fairly portable client-side JavaScript.  No server support is needed.
Everything works even if the <q>web folder</q> is burned to a CD-ROM, say.</li>
</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation (if JavaScript is available).</li>
<li>Can optionally scale the image to fill the browser windows.
The image is automatically rescaled if the browser window is resized.
This is nice for full-screen mode, for example.
(This feature requires JavaScript.)</li>
<li>A nice slider mode.  (This also requires JavaScript.)</li>
<li>Nice bookmarkable (and search-engine-friendly) URLs for everything.
The browser's location-bar is kept up-to-date.</li>
<li>The user can select between a number of styles for viewing
each picture.  The style is remembered between pictures,
encoded in the URL.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conventions">File naming convention</h2>
<p>A suggested naming convention:  Each <code>.jpg</code>
file should follow this naming convention:  <code>prefixNnX.jpg</code>,
where <code>prefix</code> is name common to a group of files,
and <code>Nn</code> is a serial number.
(Hence <code>prefix</code> should not end in a digit.)
The <code>X</code> is an
optional code letter, for scaled/rotated images that are
normlly generated automatically: Where <code>r</code> means the picture is
right-side-up but rotated relative to the camera original;
<code>p</code> is a page-size image (scaled and perhaps cropped and rotated
so it is suitable for viewing in a web page by itself); and
<code>t</code> means a thumbnail image (scaled to show multiple images
per page).</p>

<h2 id="Suggested">Suggested procedure</h2>
<p>
If you have a group of pictures you want to web-ify,
this section gives suggested instructions for what to do.

<h3>If needed, create a <code>lib</code> directory</h3>
<p>
The <code>lib</code> directory contains files that are
shared between albums - currently two JavaScript files and
<a href="help.html"><code>help.html</code></a>.
The directory can be anywhere, if you explicitly specify
the <code>--libdir=<var>directory</var></code> when running
<code>make-xml.sh</code>.
However, if you use <code>../lib</code>, <code>../../lib</code>, or
<code>../../lib</code> (relative to the album you're working on)
then the scripts will find it automatically.
So create a directory named <code>lib</code> next to your
top-level album.
When you run <code>qalbum</code> later, it will copy the necessary
files over.

<h3>Generate initial overview files</h3>
<p>
I assume the <code>qalbum</code> script is in your path. (Alternatively,
you can type the full path instead iof just <code>qalbum</code>.)
<p>
Start by putting the <code>.jpg</code> files in the desired directory.
Then <code>cd</code> to that directory.</p>
<p>Run the <code>qalbum</code> script as follows.
If you follow the naming convention given below, you can do:
<pre>
qalbum new "Title" image1.jpg ... imageN.jpg
</pre>
<p>Here <code>"Title"</code> is the name you want on the title page
of your overview page, and <code>image1.jpg ... imageN.jpg</code>
are the image you want to display.
<p>
You can leave out the <code>image1.jpg ... imageN.jpg</code> list.
In that case <code>qalbum</code> will make a list from all the
<code>.jpg</code> files in the directory
which have the form <code>prefixNN.jpg</code> (i.e. without
the <code>X</code> code letter).  The images will be sorted by
the <code>NN</code> sequence numbers - not alphabethically.
<p>
Either way, this creates an initial <code>index.xml</code>.
It also creates an initial set of web pages.
If the current directory is <code>/home/me/vacation</code>,
then you can view the web pages and images by pointing
your browser at <code>file:/home/me/vacation/index.html</code>.

<h3>Unrotating rotated picture</h3>
<p>
Many modern cameras can detect
their <q>orientation</q> (i.e. if the camera is rotated), and write
that into the saved file.
The <code>qalbum</code> script can detect this (at least for some cameras),
and automatically takes care of the rotation.
If you have such a camera, you can skip this section.
<p>
Suppose when viewing <code>index.html</code>, a picture is rotated 90 degrees
counter-clockwise (to the left).  In that case, edit <code>index.xml</code>
to add in the corresponding <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> section:
<pre>
&lt;original rotated="left"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>If the picture is rotated 90 degrees clockwise (to the right),
instead add the following:
<pre>
&lt;original rotated="right"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Then run:
<pre>
qalbum
</pre>
<p>
This creates rotated copies of the files you specified
as <code>&lt;orginal rotated="xxx"&gt;</code>, and
also edits <code>index.xml</code> for you.
If the original file was named <code>xxxNN.jpg</code>,
the rotated file will be named <code>xxxNNr.jpg</code>.
<p>Check <code>index.html</code> with a browser to see if you got it right.
If you didn't, re-edit <code>index.xml</code>.
For any picture that was rotated the wrong way,
delete the rotated file:
<pre>
rm xxxNNr.jpg
</pre>
<p>Re-run <code>qalbum</code>.
Check again;  continue until all the pictures are right way up.

<h2 id="Format">Format of the picture-group file</h2>
<p>A picture-group file is an xml file, which looks rather like an
html file, but with different tags (element names).  Also the syntax
is more strict:  For example, for every start tag
(such as <samp>&lt;text&gt;</samp>) you have to include the end tag
(e.g. <samp>&lt;/text&gt;</samp>), and they have to be properly nested.
Also, attribute values (such as in <samp>width="1280"</samp>) have to be
quoted (with single or double quotes).
<dl>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;group&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
Each picture-group file contains a single <code><b>&lt;group&gt;</b></code>
element.
Each <samp>&lt;group&gt;</samp> must contain  <samp>&lt;title&gt;</samp>
element, followed by any number of <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> elements.
</p><p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;title&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>This must appear in  <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> element
(usually at the start), and contains the title of the folder.
It should be a short phrase describing the pictures in the group.
It is used for the HTML <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the overview page,
and can contain whatever HTML markup is legal for that.
</p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;picture&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
Each  <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp> element describes one image.
It must have an <code>id</code> attribute, which is used
to name the web page generated for that picture.
The <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp>
must contain an <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> element,
and may optionally contain <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;text&gt;</code> (zero or more),
<code>&lt;date&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;original&gt;</code> elements.
(Old <code>index.xml</code> may also contain
<code>&lt;full-image&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;small-image&gt;</code> elements.)
</p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;image&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>This contains the name of the actual <code>jpg</code> image file.
This is normally the original, un-rotated, un-scaled image
downloaded from the camera.
(In old <code>index.xml</code> files, this is used for the scaled
medium-sized image, and <code>&lt;full-image&gt;</code> is the
large un-scaled file.)
</p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;date&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
Each <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp> may also have a <samp>&lt;date&gt;</samp>
element specifying when the picture was taken.
The format is not free-form; I suggest (and the <code>qalbum</code>
script generates) <code>YYYY/MM/DD</code>.
(Unfortunately, ISO format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> is awkward for ranges.)
The <samp>&lt;date&gt;</samp> can appear in a <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp>,
or at <samp>&lt;group&gt;</samp> level; in the latter case it applies
to all following <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp> until overridden.
</p><p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;caption&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
Each <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp> may in addition have a
short <samp>&lt;caption&gt;</samp>.  This is used as a short
description of the picture in the overview page, and it is used
as the page title in the picture page.
It can contain HTML markup.
</p><p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;text&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>This can appear either in a <samp>&lt;group&gt;</samp>
or in a <samp>&lt;picture&gt;</samp>.
In both cases, it can contain aribitrary HTML markup, and is formatted
as a paragraph.  (Multiple <samp>&lt;text&gt;</samp> elements
translate to multiple HTML paragraphs.)
Any <samp>&lt;text&gt;</samp> elements at <code>&lt;group&gt;</code>
level (i.e. not in a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>) are displayed
on the overview page, the slider, and the next following
picture page.
Any <samp>&lt;text&gt;</samp> elements inside a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>
are only displayed on that picture's page, not the overview page.
</p><p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;original&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
This is used to mark an image that was rotated.
It has n attribute <code>rotated</code>, which value is
either <code>"left"</code> (if the original camara image is
rotated 90 degrees left) or <code>"right"</code> (the original was rotated
right).
</p><p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;outtake&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
This is used to name alternative but presumably inferior images.
It has the form:
<pre>
&lt;outtake img="<i>filenameNN</i>.jpg"/&gt;
</pre>
or
<pre>
&lt;outtake img="<i>filenameNN</i>.jpg"&gt;<i>descriptive-text</i>&lt;/outtake&gt;
</pre>
The elements are ignored, except in the information page of the
enclosing <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>,
which contains links to the outtake images.
This allows the interested viewer to look at alternate images,
without cluttering up the normal view.
Note that you would remove <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> elements
for outtake pictures, and instead place <code>&lt;outtake&gt;</code> elements
in the selected (non-outtake) <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> elements.
</p><p>
</dl>
<p>
Obsolete entries, which you might see in old <code>index.xml</code> files:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;full-image&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>This used to contain the name of the large unscaled image file.</p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;small-image&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>This used to contain the name of the thumbnail-sized scaled image file.</p>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;row&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>This was seldom used, but could be used to ensure that a
group of <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> are all displayed on the same
row in the overview page.
If you leave out <samp>&lt;row&gt;</samp> elements,
the pictures will be displayed as many as will fit on a line.
(It used to be 3 on a line, except that if there were 4 pictures they
would be displayed as 2+2</p><p>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The <code><b>&lt;select&gt;</b></code> element:
<dd>
Select pictures based on a file-name pattern.
The attribute <code>path=<var>path</var></code> names the pattern.
Symbolic links will be created for the files that match <var>path</var>.
The pattern names a file path with certain special characters:
The character <code>*</code> matches any character (except <code>/</code>).
The pattern <code>{<var>num1</var>..<var>num2</var>}</code> matches
any integer in the range from <var>num1</var> to <var>num2</var> inclusive.
These special characters are not allowed in the directory (if any)
of the <var>path</var>.
The attribute <code>quality=<var>min-quality</var></code> is used to select
only the pictures that have the mininum quality rating (or that are unrated).
The attribute <code><var>as=<var>path</code> can be used to specify the
name to be used for links.</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element may have
<code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> child elements.
Then any information in the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element will
override or add to that extracted from the file, such
as a <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>.
</dt>

<h2 id="Download">Installing: Files to download and dependencies</h2>
<p>These scripts have been run using the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/">Qexo (Kawa XQuery)</a>
XML processor.  There is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/XQ-Gen-XML.html">an (old) article</a>
that explains how it works.
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most of <code>qalbum</code> is pure Java, except for a small
<code>bash</code> wrapper, and should run
on any system with JDK 1.4.  However, I have made no attempt to
run <code>qalbum</code> on anything except GNU/Linux system (specifically
Fedora).  It should work fine on any-Unix-like OS.
If you try to get this working on Windows, I'd like to hear about it.
<li><p>You need a Java implementation,
specifically one that has the <code>javax.imagio</code>
classes added in JDK 1.4.</li>
<li><p>You need <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/">Kawa</a>
(version 1.9.1 or the latest from SVN);
see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/Getting-Kawa.html">instructions for getting Kawa</a>.
<li><p>
You need the <code>jpegtran</code> program installed in your path.
This is used to loss-lessly rotate images when needed.
This could probably be replaced by pure Java code,
but I haven't done so yet.
Most GNU/Linux distributes provide a jpegtran package;
you can also download <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">source code</a> or
a <a href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/jpegtran.exe">MS-Windows executable</a>.
<li><p>
You also need <a href="http://www.drewnoakes.com/code/exif/">Dawn Oakes's
metadata-extractor</a>, but this is included in the <code>qalbum</code>
distribution for convenience.
</ul>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>Get <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/kawa/qalbum-1.2.tgz"><code>qalbum-1.2.tgz</code></a> or a later version from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/kawa/"><code>ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/kawa/</code></a>.
Note that not all versions of <code>qalbum-XXX.tgz</code>
are going to compabitble for all versions of Kawa,
but the latest versions should work.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Extract <code>qalbum.tgz</code> into a suitable directory.
<p>In that directory create a <code>kawa.jar</code> link:
<pre>
cd qalbum && ln -s /my/path/to/kawa-1.9.1.jar kawa.jar
</pre>
<p>The following step is optional, unless there is some version
inconsistency between <code>qalbum-<var>version</var>.jar</code> and Kawa.
It does require JDK, rather than just JRE, and a Unix-like environment
(like GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, or Cygwin)::
<pre>
make clean && make
</pre>
<p>
You might want to create a symlink from some directory on your
<code>$PATH</code> to the <code>qalbum/qalbum</code> script.
<p>
That should be it.  The <code>qalbum</code> script is smart enough to chase
symlinks and find the needed helper files.
It assumes either of the environment variables <code>JAVA</code>
or <code>JAVA_HOME</code> has been set, or <code>java</code> is in
your <code>$PATH</code>.

<h3>Home page</h3>

<p>The <code>qalbum</code> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/qalbum">home page</a>.

<h2 id="License">Author and license stuff</h2>
<p>
These scripts were written by
<a href="http://www.bothner.com/~per">Per Bothner</a>
<code>&lt;<a href="mailto:per@bothner.com">Per Bothner</a>&gt;</code>.
<p>
You are free to use these for your own images (personal or business).
I of course make NO WARRANTY; if they should happen to destroy
your critical files, I'm sorry, but you should have been more careful.
<p>
If you use <code>qalbum</code> for you pictures, I would appreciate
hearing about it.
<p>
Please do not redistribute the scripts in a product or as
part of some other software distribution without permission.
I expect you to customise the scripts for your own use; if you
make significant enhancements, I would appreciate hearing about it.
