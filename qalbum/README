This is qalbum, a tool from generating web pages from images.

See index.html for documentation.
The home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/qexoo/qalbum.

This requires Java, including the JDK 1.5 image features.
Included are both source code and a pre-compiled jar, qalbum.jar.
For convenience, it also includes Dawn Oakes' metadata-extractor.
