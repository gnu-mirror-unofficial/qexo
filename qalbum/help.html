<h1>Help for viewing QAlbum photo albums</h1>

<p>This album is generated with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/qexo/qalbum"><code>qalbum</code></a>.</p>
It is intended that it work on all browsers,
but it works best with modern browsers with CSS and JavaScript enabled.</p>

<h2>Mouse actions</h2>
<p>In addition to the obvious buttons (in yellow), some
other useful mouse action are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Clicking on the left-most 10% of the window moves to the previous picture,
while clicking on the right-most 10% of the window moves to the next picture.
These are useful when the buttons are hidden, or when viewing on a small screen, like a phone.
<li>Clicking in the main area of the screen hides the various buttons
and text, so you can see just the image.  Clicking again brings them back.
This is equivalent to typing <code>h</code> (for <q>hide</q>) on the keyboard.
<li>You can zoom in or out if you have a scroll mouse.
<li>You can drag the image around (by pushing the mouse button, and then
moving the mouse while keeping the mouse button pushed).  This is useful
when the image is zoomed.
</ul>

<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<p>These keyboard shortcuts might be easier than clicking.
(They only work if JavaScript is enabled.)

<dl>
 <dt>p</dt><dd>Go to the Previous image.</dd>
 <dt>n</dt><dd>Go to the Next image.</dd>
 <dt>u</dt><dd>Go Up to the index page.</dd>
 <dt>l</dt><dd>Show the Large image.</dd>
 <dt>i</dt><dd>Show the Information page.</dd>
 <dt>m</dt><dd>Show the Medium (default) page.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>OBSOLETE information on picture styles</h2>

<p>You can choose between different picture sizes and display styles
using the Style selector.  (Some of the styles require JavaScript to
be enabled.  If JavaScript is not available,
you get buttons to choose between the Medium, Large, and Info styles.)

<dl>
  <dt>Medium</dt>
  <dd>The default style shows a picture scaled to at most
    740 pixels in either direction.
    This is suitable for low-to-moderate bandwidth connections,
    and should work for any display at least 800 pixels wide.</dd>
  <dt>Large</dt>
  <dd>This currently uses the original unscaled image,
      so it is best for high-bandwidth connections and larger displays.
    What with increasing camera resulations, in the future we might
    need to add an extra <q>huge</q> size for originals.)</dd>
   <dt>Information</dt>
   <dd>This shows a small (thumbnail) image, but also shows
     various <q>EXIF</q> information about the camera and the image.
     It also has direct links to the image (<code>.jpg</code>) files,
     and any outtake/alternative images.</dd>
   <dt>Large, scaled</dt>
   <dd>Uses the large image, and automatically scaled it to fit
     the current window.
     This means you don't have to scroll the picture if it doesn't fit.
     It is very nice for fullscreen mode.
     The initial navigation links and text may overlap the image,
     depending on the relative image and window sizes.
     Type <q><code>h</code></q> to hide the links and text;
     another <q><code>h</code></q> brings them back.</dd>
   <dt>Large, scaled, no text</dt>
   <dd>Same as the previous style followed by typing <q><code>h</code></q>
     to hide the links and text.
     Type <q><code>h</code></q> brings them back.</dd>
   <dt>Medium, scaled</dt>
   <dd>Same as <q>Large, scaled</q>, but uses the medium image.
     This downloads and displays much faster, but the pictures aren't
     quite as nice-looking.
   <dt>Medium, scaled, no text</dt>
   <dd>Same as <q>Large, scaled, no text</q>, but uses the medium image.</dd>
   <dt>Slider</dt>
   <dd>On the left shows a scrollable frame with all the images,
     while the rest of the window matches the medium image.
     This makes it easy to navigate to the picture you want.</dd>
